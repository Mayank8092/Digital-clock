# Digital-clock
I develop this digital clock using python.


Here's a brief description of the code:

Import the necessary libraries, including time for time-related functions and tkinter for the graphical user interface.

Define a function update_time() that gets the current time using time.strftime() and updates the clock label's text every second.

Create the main window using tk.Tk() and set its title.
Create a label (clock_label) that will display the time. Configure its font, background, and text color.

Call update_time() to start the clock by initially displaying the time and scheduling it to update every second.

Run the main event loop with root.mainloop(), which keeps the graphical interface responsive and continuously updates the time display.

When you run this code, it will create a simple digital clock window that shows the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds, updating every second.
